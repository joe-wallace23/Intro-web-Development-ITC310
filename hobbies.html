        My hobby is making small web projects to display to other people.
        I believe what makes a good web developer is practice this is the key to understanding the materials better. 
        By making a lot of web projects 
        I was able to develop a portfolio that shows all of my hard work and a little 
        information about myself. As a web developer, an individual should never stop learning 
        news programming skills that will help that individual become a better web 
        developer in the future.
