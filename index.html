    <p>
        Hello, my name is Joseph Wallace, I am a senior at Missouri State University. I am an open-minded person that likes to try out new things that will interest me during college that involves my major; When I graduate in the Spring of 2022. I will enjoy having a web development job going into the fall of 2022. 
        I plan on not going to grad school because in the IT field  I 
        really do not need to get a master degree.
