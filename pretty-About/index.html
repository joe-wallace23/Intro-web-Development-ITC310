            My hobby is making small web projects to display to other people. I believe to be a good web developer practice is the key to understand the materials better. By making a lot of web projects I was able to develop a portfolio that shows all of my hard work and a little information about myself. As a web developer, a individual should never stop learning new skills that will help that 
            individual become a better web developer.
